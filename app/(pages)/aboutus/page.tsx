                  Deception is another form of misconduct that we do not accept
                  on our platform. The difference between scam and deception is
                  as follows: a scammer usually lies to receive money from a
                  person he or she wants to scam. In the meantime, the deception
                  may be something fake ‚Äì like the name in your profile that is
                  not yours.

                  We conduct business by rendering the services right to the
                  users. Thus, we desire to have top-quality contractors. To
                  verify the contractors, we conduct KYC and/or AML audits. We
                  believe this can help us detect fraudulent activities (if any)
                  of our contemplated contractors and let us know if it is
                  reasonable to work with the relevant company or not.
